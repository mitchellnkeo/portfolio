    description: 'A web-based decision support tool for urban planners, built for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2024. Combines NASA Earth observation data with local Seattle datasets to help planners make data-driven decisions about sustainable urban growth.',
    problem: 'Urban planners need to make complex decisions about sustainable development, balancing factors like air quality, population density, urban sprawl, and climate risks. Traditional tools don\'t effectively integrate Earth observation data with local datasets or provide AI-powered recommendations for development priorities.',
    solution: 'Built an interactive web application that visualizes complex geospatial data on a Leaflet map and provides AI-powered recommendations.
