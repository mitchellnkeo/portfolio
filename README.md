## Development Notes for Cursor AI

When building this portfolio:

1. **Start with a solid foundation**: Set up the project with proper TypeScript configuration, ESLint, and Prettier
2. **Mobile-first approach**: Design and code for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
3. **Component reusability**: Create reusable components that can be easily maintained and updated
4. **Performance from the start**: Implement lazy loading, image optimization, and efficient rendering patterns
5. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements for accessibility and SEO
6. **Type safety**: Leverage TypeScript fully - create proper types for all data structures
7. **Error handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
8. **Testing consideration**: Structure code to be easily testable (though testing implementation is optional for MVP)

The goal is to create a portfolio that not only showcases Mitchell's work but also demonstrates his attention to detail, technical skills, and understanding of modern web development best practices.
