# Public Images

Images in this folder are served at the root path and can be referenced with absolute paths.

**Usage:**
```jsx
// In HTML or components
<img src="/images/my-image.jpg" alt="Description" />

// Or in meta tags
<meta property="og:image" content="/images/og-image.jpg" />
```

**Best for:**
- Favicons
- Open Graph images (og-image.jpg)
- Images referenced in index.html
- Large images that don't need optimization
- Images that need to be at a specific URL
